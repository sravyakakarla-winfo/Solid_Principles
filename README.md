##Resistor Color Coding App
This is a C# console application that helps users find the color code of a resistor based on the given resistance value (in ohms) and tolerance percentage.

Features:
Takes resistance and tolerance as input from the user.

Converts the values into resistor color bands using the standard 4-band resistor code.

Displays the color bands with appropriate console text colors.

If the color is black, the background switches to white for better visibility.

Allows users to try multiple values until they press 'q' to quit.

Validates the tolerance value and prompts again if it's invalid.
